### Scenario 0

**Agents**

- A neighborhood: A few solar panels and households with smart thermostats and applicances,  EV chargers, and EV batteries

**Mechanism**

- The solar panel generators and EV batteries want to sell energy back to the grid. This is done via a double auction mechanism.  

**What we aim to demonstrate**

- We demonstrate, using real grid usage data, that selling energy via a double auction mechanism demonstrates more returns for electricity sellers, more cost savings for electricity consumers, and more renewable penetatration in the grid.
