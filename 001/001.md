### Scenario 1

**Agents**

- A coalition of agents in microgrid, including renewable energy producers, smart meters, and battery systems

**Mechanism**

- The agents perform a coalition formation game to cooperate to both sell excess electricity back to other microgrids, and to schedule demand shifting within the microgrid. The profits are distributed amongst the players using a fair allocation algorithm such as Shapley Value or Nucleolus.

**What we aim to demonstrate**

- The agents can gain more profit by joining the coalition than by operating independently, and more renewable energy is utilized in the grid.
