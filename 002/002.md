### Scenario 2

**Agents**

- A neighborhood: energy consumers such as households with smart thermostats, applicances, and EV chargers

**Mechanism**

- The agents, using predictive modeling on usage data, decide when to schedule energy consumption.

**What we aim to demonstrate**

- We aim to demonstrate that, using smarter modeling and real-time signals, we can outperform existing demand response mechanisms such as time-of-use pricing.
